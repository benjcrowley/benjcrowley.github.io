      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Sneaker Script App</h3>
      <p>
        My most recent project was the creation of a sneaker script app. This project required extensive knowledge of React for the front-end and Python for the back-end. The goal was to build a user-friendly app that would automate the process of purchasing limited edition sneakers. I am proud to say that the app was a success and received positive feedback from users.
